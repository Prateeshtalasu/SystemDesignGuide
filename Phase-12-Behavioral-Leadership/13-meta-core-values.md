# 📘 Meta's Core Values: Demonstrating Cultural Alignment

## Why This Exists

Meta (Facebook) evaluates candidates against core values that define their culture. While less explicitly structured than Amazon's LPs, these values guide hiring and promotion decisions.

Understanding Meta's values matters because:
1. **They guide evaluation**: Interviewers assess alignment with these values
2. **They determine fit**: Cultural fit is critical at Meta
3. **They shape questions**: Interviewers ask questions to assess these values
4. **They influence hiring**: Even strong engineers can be rejected for poor cultural fit

Meta's culture emphasizes moving fast, taking risks, and having impact. Your stories should demonstrate these values.

## What Breaks Without Value Alignment

Without demonstrating Meta's values:

- **You seem like a poor fit**: Even if technically strong, you may not get an offer
- **Your stories don't resonate**: They don't align with Meta's culture
- **You miss evaluation criteria**: You don't know what interviewers are looking for
- **You can't prepare effectively**: You don't know which values to demonstrate

**The interview signal**: Candidates who don't demonstrate Meta's values are seen as not understanding the culture, even if they're technically capable.

## Meta's Core Values

### 1. Move Fast

**What it means**: Shipping quickly, iterating rapidly, not over-engineering, bias toward action.

**What it looks like:**
- Shipping MVPs quickly
- Iterating based on feedback
- Not waiting for perfect solutions
- Making decisions quickly
- Taking calculated risks

**Story ideas:**
- You shipped something quickly that created value
- You made a quick decision that paid off
- You iterated rapidly based on feedback
- You chose speed over perfection when appropriate

**Example STAR:**
> "The product team wanted a feature in 2 weeks, but the 'right' way would take 6 weeks. Instead of saying no, I proposed shipping an MVP in 2 weeks that solved 80% of the problem, then iterating. I built the MVP, we shipped it, got user feedback, and improved it over the next month. The MVP approach was actually better because user feedback shaped the final design."

### 2. Be Bold

**What it means**: Taking risks, challenging the status quo, thinking big, not being afraid to fail.

**What it looks like:**
- Proposing ambitious solutions
- Challenging existing approaches
- Taking calculated risks
- Thinking beyond current scope
- Not being afraid to try new things

**Story ideas:**
- You proposed a bold solution others thought was risky
- You challenged an existing approach
- You took a risk that paid off
- You thought big about a problem

**Example STAR:**
> "Our team was manually processing data that took 4 hours daily. Everyone accepted this as necessary. I proposed automating it with ML, even though no one on the team had ML experience. People said it was too risky. I learned the basics, built a prototype that worked, and we automated 90% of the work. The risk paid off, and the team learned ML in the process."

### 3. Focus on Impact

**What it means**: Prioritizing work that creates the most value, measuring impact, making things that matter.

**What it looks like:**
- Prioritizing high-impact work
- Measuring outcomes, not just activity
- Making decisions based on impact
- Focusing on what moves the needle
- Creating things that create value

**Story ideas:**
- You prioritized high-impact work over interesting work
- You measured and improved impact
- You made a decision based on impact
- You created something with significant impact

**Example STAR:**
> "I had two projects: one was technically interesting (building a new framework), the other would improve user retention (fixing a critical bug). I chose the retention project because it had 10x the impact. I fixed the bug, measured the results, and retention improved by 15%. I learned that impact matters more than technical interest."

### 4. Be Open

**What it means**: Sharing information, being transparent, building in public, learning from others.

**What it looks like:**
- Sharing knowledge openly
- Being transparent about problems
- Documenting and teaching
- Learning from others
- Building in public

**Story ideas:**
- You shared knowledge that helped others
- You were transparent about a problem
- You documented something for the team
- You learned from others and applied it

**Example STAR:**
> "I discovered a performance optimization that improved our API latency by 50%. Instead of keeping it to myself, I documented it, gave a tech talk to the team, and created a guide. Three other teams adopted the optimization, improving their performance too. I learned that sharing knowledge multiplies impact."

### 5. Build Social Value

**What it means**: Creating things that help people, thinking about societal impact, making the world better.

**What it looks like:**
- Building products that help people
- Thinking about broader impact
- Making ethical decisions
- Considering societal implications
- Creating positive change

**Story ideas:**
- You made a decision considering social impact
- You built something that helped people
- You thought about ethical implications
- You created positive change

**Example STAR:**
> "I was building a recommendation feature that could increase engagement, but I realized it might create filter bubbles. I proposed adding diversity to recommendations to expose users to different perspectives. It slightly reduced engagement metrics but improved user satisfaction and created a better experience. I learned that social value matters as much as metrics."

Beyond the core values, Meta also values:

**What it means**: High engineering standards, thinking deeply, building scalable systems.

**Story ideas:**
- You improved code quality
- You designed a scalable system
- You thought deeply about a technical problem
- You set high standards

### Ownership

**What it means**: Taking responsibility for outcomes, thinking long-term, acting like an owner.

**Story ideas:**

### Growth Mindset

**What it means**: Learning continuously, improving, not being afraid to fail, seeking challenges.

**Story ideas:**
- You learned from a failure
- You improved a skill
- You took on a challenge
- You viewed setbacks as learning

## Demonstrating Meta Values in Interviews

### In Your Stories

- **Influence**: Be Bold, Focus on Impact

### In Your Questions

Ask questions that show alignment:

- "How does the team balance speed and quality?"
- "What opportunities are there for bold, high-impact work?"
- "How does the team share knowledge and learn from each other?"
- "What's the culture around taking risks?"

### In Your Behavior

Demonstrate values through how you interview:

- **Move Fast**: Show you can ship quickly, make decisions
- **Be Bold**: Show you take risks, think big
- **Focus on Impact**: Show you prioritize high-impact work
- **Be Open**: Show you share knowledge, learn from others
- **Build Social Value**: Show you think about broader impact

## Meta Values Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: The Perfectionist

## Mapping Your Stories to Meta Values

### Step 1: List Your Stories

Create a list of 10-15 stories from your career.

### Step 2: Map Each Story to Values

For each story, identify which Meta values it demonstrates.

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

Which values don't you have strong stories for? Create new stories or reframe existing ones.

### Step 4: Prepare Multiple Stories Per Value

Have 2-3 stories for each value so you can choose based on the question.

## Practice Exercise

Take 5 of your best stories and map them to Meta values:

1. Which values does each story demonstrate?
2. How would you emphasize those values in telling the story?
3. Which values are you missing stories for?
4. How could you reframe existing stories to show different values?

Create a matrix: Stories × Meta Values, and ensure you have coverage.
