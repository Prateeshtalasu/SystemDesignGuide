# 🏢 Amazon Leadership Principles: Aligning Your Stories

## Why This Exists

Amazon evaluates candidates against 16 Leadership Principles (LPs). These aren't just buzzwords. They're the actual criteria used in hiring and promotion decisions.

Understanding and demonstrating these principles is critical for Amazon interviews because:
1. **They're evaluated explicitly**: Interviewers rate you on specific LPs
2. **They guide questions**: Interviewers ask questions designed to assess LPs
3. **They determine fit**: Alignment with LPs is as important as technical skill
4. **They're used in debriefs**: Hiring decisions reference specific LPs

You don't need to demonstrate all 16 LPs in one interview, but you should have 2-3 stories per principle ready.

## What Breaks Without LP Alignment

Without understanding Amazon's Leadership Principles:

- **You miss the evaluation criteria**: You don't know what interviewers are looking for
- **Your stories don't resonate**: They don't align with Amazon's values
- **You seem like a poor fit**: Even if technically strong, you may not get an offer
- **You can't prepare effectively**: You don't know which stories to tell

**The interview signal**: Candidates who can't demonstrate LPs are seen as not understanding Amazon's culture, even if they're technically capable.

## The 16 Amazon Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession

**What it means**: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust.

**What it looks like:**
- Making decisions based on customer impact, not internal convenience
- Going above and beyond to solve customer problems
- Prioritizing customer experience over short-term metrics
- Understanding customer needs deeply

**Story ideas:**
- You changed a technical decision because it hurt customers
- You fixed a bug that was causing customer pain, even though it wasn't your area
- You proposed a feature based on customer feedback
- You went the extra mile to ensure a good customer experience

**Example STAR:**
> "I noticed our checkout flow had a 15% abandonment rate. I analyzed customer session recordings and found that users were confused by our payment form. Even though the form 'worked,' it wasn't customer-friendly. I redesigned it with clearer labels and better error messages. Abandonment dropped to 8%, and customer support tickets about checkout decreased by 40%."

### 2. Ownership

**What it means**: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their team.

**What it looks like:**
- Taking responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks
- Thinking about the whole system, not just your piece
- Fixing problems you didn't create
- Making decisions that benefit the company long-term

**Story ideas:**
- You fixed a bug in code you didn't write
- You improved documentation that wasn't your responsibility
- You proposed a solution that required cross-team coordination
- You made a decision that was harder short-term but better long-term

**Example STAR:**
> "I noticed our deployment process was causing production incidents. Even though deployments weren't my responsibility, I owned the problem. I analyzed 6 months of incident data, identified the root causes, and proposed an automated deployment pipeline. I got buy-in from DevOps, wrote the implementation plan, and led the rollout. Incidents dropped by 60%, and deployment time improved from 4 hours to 15 minutes."

### 3. Invent and Simplify

**What it means**: Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here."

**What it looks like:**
- Finding simpler solutions to complex problems
- Proposing innovative approaches
- Learning from other companies/teams
- Eliminating unnecessary complexity

**Story ideas:**
- You simplified a complex process or system
- You proposed a creative solution to a hard problem
- You learned from another team/company and applied it
- You eliminated unnecessary features or complexity

**Example STAR:**
> "Our team was building a complex recommendation system with 5 different models. I realized we were over-engineering. I analyzed the data and found that a simple collaborative filtering approach achieved 90% of the accuracy with 10% of the complexity. I proposed simplifying to one model, got buy-in, and we shipped 3 months faster. The simpler system was also easier to maintain and debug."

### 4. Are Right, A Lot

**What it means**: Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**What it looks like:**
- Making good decisions with incomplete information
- Using data and intuition effectively
- Seeking input but making the call
- Being right more often than wrong

**Story ideas:**
- You made a technical decision that turned out to be correct
- You pushed back on a bad idea and were proven right
- You used data to make a judgment call
- You trusted your instincts when data was incomplete

**Example STAR:**
> "The team wanted to use a new database technology for our project. I was skeptical because it was unproven at our scale. I researched it, talked to engineers at other companies, and ran a proof-of-concept. My analysis showed it wouldn't handle our load. I presented my findings and recommended sticking with our current solution. Six months later, a competitor who adopted that technology had major outages. We avoided that risk."

### 5. Learn and Be Curious

**What it means**: Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**What it looks like:**
- Proactively learning new technologies or skills
- Asking questions to understand deeply
- Experimenting with new approaches
- Sharing what you learn with others

**Story ideas:**
- You learned a new technology to solve a problem
- You dug deep into a system to understand it
- You experimented with a new approach
- You taught yourself something complex

**Example STAR:**
> "I was assigned to optimize our search functionality, but I had no experience with search engines. I spent a week learning Elasticsearch, reading documentation, and building small prototypes. I then designed and implemented a solution that improved search relevance by 40% and reduced latency by 60%. I also documented what I learned and gave a knowledge-sharing session to the team."

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best

**What it means**: Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. They develop leaders.

**What it looks like:**
- Mentoring and growing other engineers
- Setting high standards in hiring
- Providing honest feedback
- Helping others advance their careers

**Story ideas:**
- You mentored someone who grew significantly
- You provided critical feedback that helped someone improve
- You advocated for someone's promotion
- You helped someone develop new skills

**Example STAR:**
> "A junior engineer on my team was struggling with system design. I set up weekly design review sessions where we'd work through problems together. I gave them progressively complex design challenges and provided detailed feedback. After 6 months, they were independently designing systems and got promoted. They told me the mentoring was transformative."

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

**What it means**: Leaders have relentlessly high standards. Many people think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes.

**What it looks like:**
- Not accepting "good enough" when excellence is possible
- Raising quality standards
- Holding yourself and others accountable
- Refusing to ship low-quality work

**Story ideas:**
- You pushed back on shipping something that wasn't ready
- You raised the quality bar for your team
- You refused to cut corners
- You improved a process to meet higher standards

**Example STAR:**
> "Our team was under pressure to ship a feature by a deadline. The code worked but had no tests, minimal error handling, and poor documentation. I insisted we couldn't ship it. I proposed a plan: we'd cut one nice-to-have feature to make time for proper testing and error handling. I got buy-in, we implemented it properly, and we shipped 3 days late but with zero production bugs. The feature has been stable for 2 years."

### 8. Think Big

**What it means**: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**What it looks like:**
- Proposing ambitious solutions
- Thinking beyond immediate scope
- Challenging assumptions about what's possible
- Inspiring others with vision

**Story ideas:**
- You proposed a solution that seemed ambitious but was right
- You thought beyond your immediate task
- You challenged "we can't do that" thinking
- You inspired a team with a bold vision

**Example STAR:**
> "Our team was manually processing 1000 support tickets per day. Everyone accepted this as necessary. I proposed automating 80% of them using ML classification and automated responses. People said it was impossible. I built a proof-of-concept that achieved 75% accuracy. I got buy-in, we built the full system, and we now process 800 tickets automatically. The team can focus on complex issues."

### 9. Bias for Action

**What it means**: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**What it looks like:**
- Making decisions quickly when appropriate
- Taking action rather than over-analyzing
- Experimenting and iterating
- Not waiting for perfect information

**Story ideas:**
- You made a quick decision that paid off
- You started building before having all the answers
- You ran an experiment instead of debating
- You took action when others were still planning

**Example STAR:**
> "The team was debating for 2 weeks about which caching strategy to use. I proposed we stop debating and run a 1-week experiment with each approach. I set up the experiments, we measured the results, and we made a data-driven decision in 1 week instead of continuing to debate. We chose the simpler approach, which worked perfectly."

### 10. Frugality

**What it means**: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

**What it looks like:**
- Finding ways to do more with less
- Optimizing costs
- Being resourceful with constraints
- Not asking for more resources as the first solution

**Story ideas:**
- You optimized infrastructure costs
- You solved a problem without adding headcount
- You found a creative solution with limited resources
- You reduced waste or inefficiency

**Example STAR:**
> "Our database costs were growing 20% per month. Instead of asking for more budget, I analyzed our usage and found we were over-provisioned. I implemented query optimization, added caching, and right-sized our instances. We reduced costs by 40% while maintaining performance. I also set up monitoring to prevent future cost creep."

### 11. Earn Trust

**What it means**: Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume.

**What it looks like:**
- Admitting mistakes openly
- Being honest about problems
- Listening to others' concerns
- Building trust through consistency

**Story ideas:**
- You admitted a mistake and fixed it
- You were honest about a problem when it was uncomfortable
- You listened to feedback and acted on it
- You built trust through reliable delivery

**Example STAR:**
> "I made a mistake in a deployment that caused a 30-minute outage. Instead of making excuses, I immediately took responsibility, communicated the issue transparently, and led the fix. Afterward, I wrote a post-mortem, shared it with the team, and implemented safeguards to prevent it. My manager said my transparency and ownership actually increased trust in me."

### 12. Dive Deep

**What it means**: Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ. No task is beneath them.

**What it looks like:**
- Understanding systems at a deep level
- Not accepting surface-level explanations
- Getting into the details when needed
- Being hands-on, not just delegating

**Story ideas:**
- You debugged a complex problem by diving deep
- You understood a system thoroughly before making changes
- You didn't accept "it just works" - you understood why
- You got into details others avoided

**Example STAR:**
> "Our API was experiencing intermittent latency spikes. The team assumed it was database load, but I wasn't satisfied with that explanation. I spent 2 days diving deep: analyzing logs, tracing requests, profiling code, and reading database query plans. I discovered it was actually a memory leak in our caching layer that only appeared under specific load patterns. I fixed it, and latency became consistent."

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

**What it means**: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**What it looks like:**
- Pushing back on bad ideas respectfully
- Having conviction in your position
- Committing fully once a decision is made
- Not compromising just to avoid conflict

**Story ideas:**
- You disagreed with a decision and pushed back
- You had conviction in your technical judgment
- You committed to a decision you disagreed with
- You stood your ground when it mattered

**Example STAR:**
> "The team wanted to use a new framework for our project. I disagreed because it was unproven and would add risk. I presented data showing similar projects had failed with this framework. We debated for a week. The team decided to use it anyway. Once the decision was made, I committed fully. I learned the framework, helped implement it, and made it successful. The project shipped on time."

### 14. Deliver Results

**What it means**: Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**What it looks like:**
- Consistently delivering on commitments
- Overcoming obstacles to deliver
- Focusing on outcomes, not just activity
- Not making excuses when things are hard

**Story ideas:**
- You delivered a project despite obstacles
- You overcame significant challenges to meet a deadline
- You focused on results, not just process
- You didn't give up when things got hard

**Example STAR:**
> "I was leading a project with a hard deadline. Midway through, we discovered a critical dependency was delayed. Instead of accepting the delay, I found an alternative approach, worked extra hours to implement it, and coordinated with 3 other teams to make it work. We delivered on time. The alternative approach actually turned out to be better than the original plan."

### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer

**What it means**: Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher-performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun.

**What it looks like:**
- Creating an inclusive environment
- Helping others succeed
- Making work enjoyable
- Building team culture

**Story ideas:**
- You helped create a more inclusive team
- You made work more enjoyable for others
- You helped someone through a difficult time
- You built team culture or processes

**Example STAR:**
> "I noticed our team wasn't very collaborative - people worked in silos. I organized weekly tech talks where people could share what they were working on, started a 'lunch and learn' series, and created a team Slack channel for sharing interesting articles. Team collaboration improved, people felt more connected, and knowledge sharing increased. People said the team felt more like a community."

### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

**What it means**: We started in a garage, but we're not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions.

**What it looks like:**
- Considering broader impact of your work
- Thinking about unintended consequences
- Taking responsibility for impact beyond your team
- Being thoughtful about scale

**Story ideas:**
- You considered the broader impact of a technical decision
- You thought about unintended consequences
- You took responsibility for impact beyond your scope
- You made a decision considering scale

**Example STAR:**
> "I designed a feature that would work great for our current scale but wouldn't scale to 10x. I realized this would create technical debt. I redesigned it to be scalable from the start, even though it took 2 extra weeks. When we grew 5x in the next year, we didn't have to rewrite it. The scalable design paid off."

## Mapping Your Stories to LPs

### Step 1: List Your Stories

Create a list of 15-20 stories from your career.

### Step 2: Map Each Story to LPs

For each story, identify which LPs it demonstrates (most stories show 2-3 LPs).

### Step 3: Identify Gaps

Which LPs don't you have strong stories for? Create new stories or reframe existing ones.

### Step 4: Prepare 2-3 Stories Per LP

Have multiple stories for each LP so you can choose based on the question.

---

## Using LPs in Interviews

### When Asked Directly

If an interviewer asks "Tell me about a time you demonstrated Customer Obsession":

1. **Acknowledge the LP**: "That's a great question about Customer Obsession."
2. **Tell your STAR story**: Use your prepared story
3. **Explicitly connect**: "This demonstrates Customer Obsession because..."
4. **Be ready for follow-ups**: They may ask about other LPs

### When Not Asked Directly

Even if not asked about a specific LP, you can demonstrate them:

- In project ownership stories: Show Ownership, Deliver Results
- In conflict stories: Show Have Backbone, Earn Trust
- In mentoring stories: Show Hire and Develop the Best
- In decision stories: Show Are Right A Lot, Dive Deep

### In Your Questions

You can ask interviewers about LPs:

- "Which Leadership Principles are most important for this role?"
- "Can you give me an example of how [LP] is demonstrated on your team?"
- "How does Amazon evaluate [LP] in performance reviews?"

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **LPs are evaluation criteria**: Interviewers rate you on these
2. **Prepare 2-3 stories per LP**: Have options for each principle
3. **Most stories show multiple LPs**: One story can demonstrate 2-3 principles
4. **Connect explicitly**: When relevant, mention which LP you're demonstrating
5. **Be authentic**: Don't force stories - find real examples
6. **Practice mapping**: Know which stories show which LPs
7. **Fill gaps**: If you're missing stories for certain LPs, create them

---

## Practice Exercise

Take 5 of your best stories and map them to Leadership Principles:

1. Which LPs does each story demonstrate?
2. How would you explicitly connect the story to the LP?
3. Which LPs are you missing stories for?
4. How could you reframe existing stories to show different LPs?

Create a matrix: Stories × LPs, and ensure you have coverage.
