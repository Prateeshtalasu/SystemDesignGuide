## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Q: I'm confused about a topic. Where do I start?**
A: Start with Phase 1, Topic 1 (Distributed Systems). Each topic includes prerequisites at the beginning.

**Q: How do I find related topics?**
A: Use the Cross-References section above. Topics that build on each other are clearly linked.

**Q: Where can I find troubleshooting guidance?**
A: See `Phase-11-Production-Engineering/12-debugging-oncall.md` for production debugging strategies.

**Q: Are the code examples production-ready?**
A: They're educational examples designed to teach concepts. Production code requires additional error handling, logging, and security considerations.

**Q: How do I practice effectively?**
A: Follow the learning strategy above. Code the LLD problems yourself before looking at solutions. Draw HLD designs before reading the deep-dives.

## 💡 Key Principles

> **Quality > Speed**: Take time to understand deeply
> 
> **Understanding > Memorization**: Know the "why" not just the "what"
> 
> **Practice > Theory**: Code LLD, design HLD, do mock interviews
> 
> **Consistency > Intensity**: 2-3 hours daily beats 10 hours once a week
> 
> **You're building a career foundation, not cramming for an exam**
