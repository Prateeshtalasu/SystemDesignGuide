# 🎓 System Design Mastery - Complete Curriculum

**Goal**: FAANG L5+ System Design Interview Readiness  
**Duration**: 16-20 weeks (self-paced)  
**Approach**: Deep understanding > Surface memorization

---

## 📊 Learning Strategy

### Phases Overview
- **Weeks 1-2**: Foundations (Phase 1-2)
- **Weeks 3-6**: Core Systems (Phase 3-7)
- **Weeks 7-10**: Low-Level Design (Phase 8)
- **Weeks 11-14**: High-Level Design (Phase 9)
- **Weeks 15-16**: Production & Meta-skills (Phase 10-13)

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning (2hrs)**: Study new topic (generate with Cursor)
2. **Afternoon (1hr)**: Implement/practice (code LLD, draw HLD)
3. **Evening (30min)**: Review previous topics (spaced repetition)

### Quality Checkpoints
- After each topic: Explain it out loud without notes
- After each phase: Complete practice problems
- Weekly: Review all phase topics in 1 sitting
