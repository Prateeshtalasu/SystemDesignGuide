# 🧠 PHASE 13: INTERVIEW META-SKILLS (Week 16)

**Goal**: Master the interview game

## Topics:

1. **Problem Approach Framework**
   - Clarify requirements (5-10 min)
   - High-level design (15-20 min)
   - Deep dive (15-20 min)
   - Trade-offs & alternatives (5-10 min)

2. **Requirements Clarification**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional (scale, latency, consistency)
   - Out of scope
   - Template questions

3. **Back-of-Envelope Calculations**
   - QPS calculation
   - Storage estimation
   - Bandwidth estimation
   - Memory (cache) sizing
   - Practice 20 examples

4. **Common Follow-ups by Topic**
   - Database: "How do you handle hot partitions?"
   - Cache: "What if cache goes down?"
   - Messaging: "How do you ensure ordering?"
   - Learn 50+ follow-ups

5. **Level-Specific Expectations**
   - **L4 (New Grad)**: Basic design, knows trade-offs
   - **L5 (Mid-level)**: End-to-end design, deep dives
   - **L6 (Senior)**: Multiple solutions, complex trade-offs
   - Calibrate your answers

6. **Communication Tips**
   - Think out loud
   - Draw diagrams
   - Ask for feedback ("Does this make sense?")
   - Handle pushback gracefully

7. **Time Management**
   - 45-min interview breakdown
   - Don't get stuck on one component
   - Breadth before depth

8. **Common System Design Patterns**
   - Fan-out on write vs Fan-out on read
   - Write-through vs Write-behind caching
   - Sharding strategies
   - Replication patterns
   - CQRS pattern
   - Event-driven architecture

9. **Trade-off Analysis Framework**
   - Consistency vs Availability
   - Latency vs Throughput
   - Cost vs Performance
   - Complexity vs Scalability
   - How to articulate trade-offs

10. **Scalability Patterns**
    - Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
    - Database scaling patterns
    - Cache scaling patterns
    - Message queue scaling
    - CDN for static content

11. **Common Interview Scenarios**
    - "Design for 1M users, then scale to 1B"
    - "How would you handle 10x traffic spike?"
    - "What if this component fails?"
    - "How do you ensure data consistency?"
    - "What are the bottlenecks?"

12. **Drawing & Communication**
    - Whiteboard best practices
    - Diagram types (sequence, component, deployment)
    - Using standard symbols
    - Explaining complex concepts simply

## Deliverable
Can ace 10 mock interviews in a row
