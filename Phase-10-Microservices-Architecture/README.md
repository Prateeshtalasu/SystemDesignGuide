# 🚀 PHASE 10: MICROSERVICES & ARCHITECTURE (Week 15)

**Goal**: Understand modern software architecture

## Topics:

1. **Monolith vs Microservices**
   - When to use each
   - Migration strategies
   - Trade-offs

2. **Service Discovery**
   - Client-side (Eureka)
   - Server-side (Consul, ZooKeeper)
   - DNS-based

3. **REST vs gRPC**
   - When to use each
   - Performance comparison
   - Versioning strategies

4. **Database per Service**
   - Why?
   - Data duplication
   - Eventual consistency

5. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separate read/write models
   - Event sourcing integration
   - Use cases

6. **Saga Pattern**
   - Orchestration vs Choreography
   - Compensating transactions
   - Implementation

7. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Event notification vs Event-carried state transfer
   - Event sourcing
   - CQRS + Event Sourcing

8. **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**
   - Why separate backends
   - GraphQL as BFF

9. **Strangler Pattern**
   - Incremental migration
   - Monolith to microservices

10. **API Versioning**
    - URL versioning
    - Header versioning
    - Content negotiation

11. **Session Management**
    - Sticky sessions
    - Session replication
    - JWT tokens
    - Redis sessions

12. **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)**
    - Sidecar proxy pattern
    - Traffic management
    - Security (mTLS)
    - Observability integration
    - When to adopt service mesh

13. **API Gateway Patterns**
    - Single entry point
    - Request aggregation
    - Protocol translation
    - Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern
    - API composition

14. **Distributed Tracing Integration**
    - OpenTelemetry
    - Trace context propagation
    - Service dependency mapping
    - Performance bottleneck identification

15. **Microservices Communication Patterns**
    - Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
    - Asynchronous (messaging)
    - Request/Reply pattern
    - Choreography vs Orchestration
    - Event-driven communication

## Deliverable
Can architect microservices system for 100+ services
